## Project Overview

The **Salesforce Tours & Travels Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Platform** is a tailored solution designed to optimize the core operations of travel and tour businesses by leveraging Salesforce’s robust CRM capabilities. This platform centralizes the management of client inquiries, travel package selections, bookings, payments, and post-travel feedback, providing a seamless and unified experience for both staff and customers.

By automating essential tasks such as booking approvals, customer notifications, and follow-up reminders using tools like **Flows** and **Process Builder**, the system significantly enhances operational efficiency and accuracy. It also elevates the customer experience through personalized communication and secure handling of sensitive information.

Moreover, the platform delivers real-time insights through **dynamic reports and interactive dashboards**, empowering travel agencies to make informed, data-driven decisions. Ultimately, this project offers a reliable, scalable CRM solution that enables agencies to streamline workflows, improve service quality, and support sustainable business growth.

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Planning 
This phase focused on understanding the travel industry’s core business needs and translating them into a scalable Salesforce CRM solution. Key activities included gathering user requirements, defining project scope, and creating a technical roadmap to guide development. I designed the data and security models to reflect real-world travel workflows, supporting features such as booking management, customer tracking, and secure access control. This early planning ensured that the system would be structured, scalable, and aligned with both user expectations and long-term business goals.

## Understanding Business Requirements
The first milestone focused on uncovering key operational challenges faced by travel agencies, such as manual booking workflows, slow customer communication, lack of centralized feedback management, and limited cross-team coordination. By evaluating the needs of primary stakeholders—including travel agents, finance staff, and customers I translated these issues into concrete CRM requirements like booking automation, unified customer records, and real-time alerts. 

This phase deepened my understanding of how to bridge business problems with technical solutions. It also enhanced my ability to perform stakeholder analysis, prioritize user needs, and design a CRM system that addresses fragmented processes using Salesforce as an integrated platform.

## Defining Project Scope & Objectives
This milestone focused on clearly defining the scope and objectives of the CRM system. The platform was designed to manage the entire travel process from initial booking inquiries to post-trip feedback while remaining scalable for global use. Key functional needs included support for group travel, tiered memberships, dynamic pricing, and secure role-based data access. The overall goals were centered on streamlining operations through automation, improving communication speed, and enabling actionable insights through analytics.

Working through this phase strengthened my ability to set clear system boundaries. I learned the value of explicitly defining what the CRM should and shouldn’t include—especially within a limited development timeframe. This clarity helped shape development priorities and ensured that focus remained on delivering the most critical features first.
